# MusicPlayer
its... well... a absolutely bad music player. it was made w/ assistance of chat gpt and kind of a test of gpt. lesson learned: its kinda bad so you probably need to debug a lot by yourself

btw for those who want to use it just run the main file and add "build" behind it to make it an exe, if you need help just search up how to use cxfreeze
